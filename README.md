# RGB Controller of Doom

The RGB Controller of Doom is a Teensy 3.2 shield that allows the Teensy to control 4 addressable 5V RGB WS2811 headers, 1 12V RGBW/UV header, 4 fan headers (PWM control on both 3-pin and 4-pin fans), and 4 10K sensor ports for thermistors.

Commands are sent to the Teensy via the serial console over USB, and is aimed at providing a stable set of commands that can be used on any operating system.

## Progress

Currently, initial documentation is being written for things like "which pins go where", and finalizing the initial schematics so that I can start in on the PCB design.
